1. for my understanding, a person move to new apartment in a specific street
2. He need some requirements on that street or near by apartment
3. So, that the reason I write "allRequirementsAvailableInAStreet(blocks, reqs)" method there is chance to have all requirements specific also 
4. Otherwise we move to next apartment for our requirements, so that will handle the "apartmentToReachRequiredBuildings(blocks, reqs)" method.
5. so, this is my simple explanation doucment.
